## 📌 Project Ideas
### **1. Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis**
- **Objective:** Identify different customer segments based on **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** values.
- **Methods:** 
  - Compute RFM scores for each customer.
  - Apply **K-Means clustering** or **Hierarchical clustering** to group customers.
  - Visualize the segments using scatter plots or heatmaps.
- **Outcome:** Helps in identifying high-value customers, frequent buyers, and inactive customers for targeted marketing.

### **2. Sales Trend Analysis & Forecasting**
- **Objective:** Analyze sales trends over time and forecast future revenue.
- **Methods:**
  - Perform **time series analysis** on sales data.
  - Identify seasonal patterns and trends.
  - Use **ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, or LSTM** to forecast future sales.
- **Outcome:** Provides insights into peak seasons and helps in inventory planning.

### **3. Product Recommendation System**
- **Objective:** Build a recommendation system to suggest products based on past purchases.
- **Methods:**
  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommend products based on customers with similar buying behavior.
  - **Market Basket Analysis (Apriori Algorithm):** Identify frequently bought-together items.
- **Outcome:** Helps in cross-selling and increasing revenue through personalized recommendations.

### **4. Anomaly Detection in Transactions**
- **Objective:** Detect fraudulent or unusual transactions.
- **Methods:**
  - Identify unusually high order quantities or negative values.
  - Use **Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM** for anomaly detection.
  - Visualize anomalies using box plots.
- **Outcome:** Helps in fraud detection and quality control.

### **5. Customer Churn Prediction**
- **Objective:** Predict which customers are likely to stop purchasing.
- **Methods:**
  - Define churn based on **last purchase date** and inactivity period.
  - Train models like **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or XGBoost** to predict churn risk.
- **Outcome:** Helps in proactive customer retention strategies.

## 🚀 Advanced Predictive Models
### **1. Predicting Next Purchase Date**
- **Objective:** Predict when a customer is likely to make their next purchase.
- **Methods:**
  - **Time Series Forecasting:** ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, LSTMs.
- **Outcome:** Helps optimize inventory and personalize email reminders.

### **2. Sales Revenue Prediction**
- **Objective:** Predict the total revenue for the next period.
- **Methods:**
  - Regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **Outcome:** Helps in budget planning and sales target setting.

### **3. Product Demand Forecasting**
- **Objective:** Predict demand for specific products to improve inventory management.
- **Methods:**
  - **Time Series Models:** ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet.
- **Outcome:** Reduces stockouts and overstocking.

### **4. Fraudulent Transaction Detection**
- **Objective:** Detect unusual purchase patterns that indicate fraud.
- **Methods:**
  - **Anomaly Detection Algorithms:** Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders.
- **Outcome:** Reduces revenue loss from fraudulent activities.
