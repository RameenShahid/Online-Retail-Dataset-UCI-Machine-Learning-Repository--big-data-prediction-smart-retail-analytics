     - **Market Basket Analysis (Apriori Algorithm):** Identify frequently bought-together items.
   - **Outcome:** Helps in cross-selling and increasing revenue through personalized recommendations.

---

### **4. Anomaly Detection in Transactions**
   - **Objective:** Detect fraudulent or unusual transactions.
   - **Methods:**
     - Identify unusually high order quantities or negative values.
     - Use **Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM** for anomaly detection.
     - Visualize anomalies using box plots.
   - **Outcome:** Helps in fraud detection and quality control.

---

### **5. Customer Churn Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Predict which customers are likely to stop purchasing.
   - **Methods:**
     - Define churn based on **last purchase date** and inactivity period.
     - Train models like **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or XGBoost** to predict churn risk.
   - **Outcome:** Helps in proactive customer retention strategies.

### **Customer Churn Prediction & Other Predictive Models for Online Retail**  

Here’s how you can build a **Customer Churn Prediction Model** along with other predictive models using the **Online Retail Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).**  

---

## **1. Customer Churn Prediction**  
### **Objective:**  
Predict which customers are likely to stop purchasing and develop strategies to retain them.  

### **Methods:**  
1. **Define Churn:**  
   - A customer is considered "churned" if they haven't made a purchase in **X months** (e.g., 6 months).  
   - Convert into a binary classification problem:  
     - **1 = Churned**  
     - **0 = Active**  

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - **Recency:** Days since last purchase.  
   - **Frequency:** Number of transactions in a given period.  
   - **Monetary Value:** Total amount spent.  
   - **Time-based Features:** Seasonality patterns, day-of-week purchasing trends.  
   - **Product Category Preferences:** Most frequently purchased product types.  

3. **Modeling Approaches:**  
   - **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.  
   - **Advanced Models:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM).  
   - **Deep Learning:** LSTMs or Transformers for sequential transaction history.  

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  
   - AUC-ROC for imbalanced data.  

### **Outcome:**  
- Identify customers at risk of churning and develop targeted retention campaigns (e.g., personalized offers, loyalty rewards).  

---

## **2. Predicting Next Purchase Date**  
### **Objective:**  
Predict when a customer is likely to make their next purchase.  

### **Methods:**  
- Use **Time Series Forecasting**:  
  - ARIMA, Facebook Prophet.  
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction.  
- Features:  
  - Purchase frequency patterns.  
  - Seasonal variations.  
  - Customer behavior trends.  

### **Outcome:**  
- Helps optimize inventory and personalize email reminders.  

---

## **3. Sales Revenue Prediction**  
### **Objective:**  
Predict the total revenue for the next **week/month/quarter**.  

### **Methods:**  
- Feature Engineering:  
  - Past sales trends, seasonal effects, holiday impact.  
  - External factors (Google Trends, economic indicators).  
- Models:  
  - **Regression Models:** Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso.  
  - **Ensemble Learning:** XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM.  
  - **Deep Learning:** Transformer-based models (Temporal Fusion Transformer).  

### **Outcome:**  
- Helps in budget planning and sales target setting.  

---

## **4. Product Demand Forecasting**  
### **Objective:**  
Predict demand for specific products to improve inventory management.  

### **Methods:**  
- **Time Series Models:** ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet.  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Regression-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest).  
  - Neural networks for time series (LSTMs).  
- Features:  
  - Past sales data.  
  - Seasonality, trends, promotions.  

### **Outcome:**  
- Reduces stockouts and overstocking, optimizing supply chain operations.

## **5. Fraudulent Transaction Detection**  
### **Objective:**  
Detect unusual purchase patterns that indicate fraud.  

### **Methods:**  
- **Anomaly Detection Algorithms:**  
  - Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders.  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Transaction amount deviation.  
  - Unusual purchasing time (e.g., late-night orders).  
  - High-value orders with multiple returns.  

### **Outcome:**  
- Reduces revenue loss from fraudulent activities.
