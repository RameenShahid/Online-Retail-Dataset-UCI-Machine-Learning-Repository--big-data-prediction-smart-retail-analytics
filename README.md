### **1. Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis**
   - **Objective:** Identify different customer segments based on **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** values.
   - **Methods:** 
     - Compute RFM scores for each customer.
     - Apply **K-Means clustering** or **Hierarchical clustering** to group customers.
     - Visualize the segments using scatter plots or heatmaps.
   - **Outcome:** Helps in identifying high-value customers, frequent buyers, and inactive customers for targeted marketing.

### **2. Sales Trend Analysis & Forecasting**
   - **Objective:** Analyze sales trends over time and forecast future revenue.
   - **Methods:**
     - Perform **time series analysis** on sales data.
     - Identify seasonal patterns and trends.
     - Use **ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, or LSTM** to forecast future sales.
   - **Outcome:** Provides insights into peak seasons and helps in inventory planning.

---

### **3. Product Recommendation System**
   - **Objective:** Build a recommendation system to suggest products based on past purchases.
   - **Methods:**
     - **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommend products based on customers with similar buying behavior.
     - **Market Basket Analysis (Apriori Algorithm):** Identify frequently bought-together items.
   - **Outcome:** Helps in cross-selling and increasing revenue through personalized recommendations.

---

### **4. Anomaly Detection in Transactions**
   - **Objective:** Detect fraudulent or unusual transactions.
   - **Methods:**
     - Identify unusually high order quantities or negative values.
     - Use **Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM** for anomaly detection.
     - Visualize anomalies using box plots.
   - **Outcome:** Helps in fraud detection and quality control.

---

### **5. Customer Churn Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Predict which customers are likely to stop purchasing.
   - **Methods:**
     - Define churn based on **last purchase date** and inactivity period.
     - Train models like **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or XGBoost** to predict churn risk.
   - **Outcome:** Helps in proactive customer retention strategies.

## üèÜ Conclusion & Business Impact
- Helps in **customer retention** and **personalized marketing**
- Optimizes **inventory planning and demand forecasting**
- Enhances **fraud detection and revenue growth**
