## **Customer Churn Prediction & Other Predictive Models for Online Retail**  

This guide explores predictive models using the **Online Retail Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)** to enhance customer retention, sales forecasting, and fraud detection.

---

### **1. Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis**
   - **Objective:** Identify customer segments based on **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** values.
   - **Methods:** 
     - Calculate RFM scores for each customer.
     - Apply **K-Means** or **Hierarchical clustering** to group customers.
     - Visualize segments using heatmaps or scatter plots.
   - **Outcome:** Helps in identifying high-value customers, frequent buyers, and inactive customers for targeted marketing.

---

### **2. Sales Trend Analysis & Forecasting**
   - **Objective:** Analyze sales trends and predict future revenue.
   - **Methods:**
     - Perform **time series analysis** on sales data.
     - Identify seasonal trends and peak periods.
     - Use models like **ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, or LSTM** for forecasting.
   - **Outcome:** Helps optimize inventory planning and sales strategies.

---

### **3. Product Recommendation System**
   - **Objective:** Suggest relevant products based on purchase history.
   - **Methods:**
     - **Collaborative Filtering:** Identify customers with similar preferences.
     - **Market Basket Analysis (Apriori Algorithm):** Find commonly bought-together products.
   - **Outcome:** Improves cross-selling and increases revenue through personalized recommendations.

---

### **4. Anomaly Detection in Transactions**
   - **Objective:** Identify fraudulent or suspicious transactions.
   - **Methods:**
     - Detect unusually high order values or frequent returns.
     - Use **Isolation Forest** or **One-Class SVM** for anomaly detection.
     - Visualize anomalies using box plots.
   - **Outcome:** Reduces fraud-related losses and improves transaction security.

---

### **5. Customer Churn Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Predict customers likely to stop purchasing.
   - **Methods:**
     - Define churn based on inactivity (e.g., no purchases in 6 months).
     - Train models like **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or XGBoost** to predict churn.
   - **Outcome:** Enables proactive retention strategies such as personalized offers.

---

### **6. Predicting Next Purchase Date**
   - **Objective:** Forecast when a customer will make their next purchase.
   - **Methods:**  
     - **Time Series Models** (ARIMA, Facebook Prophet).  
     - **Deep Learning** (LSTMs for sequential data).  
   - **Outcome:** Helps optimize marketing timing and stock availability.

---

### **7. Sales Revenue Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Estimate future revenue for planning and budgeting.
   - **Methods:**  
     - Use past sales, seasonal trends, and external factors as predictors.  
     - Train models like **Linear Regression, XGBoost, or LSTMs**.  
   - **Outcome:** Aids in business strategy and revenue forecasting.

---

### **8. Product Demand Forecasting**
   - **Objective:** Predict demand for different products to optimize inventory.  
   - **Methods:**  
     - Time Series Models (**ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet**).  
     - Machine Learning (**Random Forest, XGBoost**).  
   - **Outcome:** Reduces overstocking and stockouts, improving supply chain efficiency.

---

### **9. Fraudulent Transaction Detection**
   - **Objective:** Identify and prevent fraudulent activities.  
   - **Methods:**  
     - Use **anomaly detection** models like **Isolation Forest** or **Autoencoders**.  
     - Analyze transaction patterns for outliers (e.g., large purchases at odd hours).  
   - **Outcome:** Minimizes financial loss from fraud.
